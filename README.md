# Coding Demo in Kotlin

### Notes

Although I have 8+ years of Android development experience it has been Java most of the time. My Kotlin experienced is resumed in a few lines of contribution when I was working as a front-end developer not responsible for de Android app but in charge of a Web app. I developed this project as personal challenge to learn more about Kotlin

### About the Demo

This mobile application is a very simple POC that uses Retrofit 2 for consuming Github API services. It retrieves and shows a list of the most starred Kotlin projects over the past few years with the possibility to access a detailed view of the project and take a look at the each repos README.md.

Happy Reviewing!
